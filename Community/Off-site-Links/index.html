# Off-Site Links Policy

**Information:** Moderation of external links may vary on our Discord server for example. We enforce a whitelist of external links. If you feel we've blocked a link by mistake, please contact our customer support.


While we generally permit off-site links, we do not allow users to post links that link to content that violates our community guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Any URL using a URL shortener - these are frequently used to disguise XSS attacks and we will remove any shortened links. Examples of URL shorteners include, but is not limited to:
	- t.co
	- goo.gl
	- The following URL shorteners in particular display ads that are not properly screened and routinely serve malware or redirects to sites that violate our guidelines. Keep in mind this is not a comprehensive list and using *any* URL shorteners that display branding or advertisements will lead to immediate moderation action against your account:
		- adf.ly
		- bit.ly
		- ow.ly
		- adfoc.us
- Links to pornographic content
- Links to websites or apps that install malware
- Links to websites or apps phishing for a user’s login credentials, financial information, etc. (any "free robux" links or Roblox trading sites will be considered to fall under this category, even if they happen to be legitimate)
- Links to websites that seek to raise funds or recruit for terrorist organizations
- Links to sites containing Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (CSAI), or pornography involving children
- Links to sites selling illegal items (according to English law), included but not limited to:
	- Firearms, firearm accessories or ammunition
	- Explosives
	- Pharmaceuticals without prescription
	- Alcohol
	- Bank account passwords, stolen credit cards, or other financial information
	- Websites selling login details to other services, including Roblox accounts
	- Counterfeit documents or currency
	- Controlled substances, including narcotics and other drugs
	- Organs
	- Endangered species or parts of endangered species
	- Nicotine, including vaping products
	- Sex or escort services
	- Unlicensed medical services
	- Human trafficking
- Links to v3rmillion.net or similar websites
- Online gambling websites
- Sports betting websites
- Links claiming the targeted website is something it is not

If you find any content on our site that violates this policy, please flag it up for moderation or otherwise contact a moderator. We want to ensure that our community is safe.

## Violations of this Policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you a message to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your account. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your account. If you get 3 strikes, your account will be terminated.
