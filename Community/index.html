				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p class="description">We take the safety and integrity of our community seriously. These community guidelines are designed to facilitate safe and constructive discourse in our communities. They set out what behaviors we encourage and which behaviors we disallow, and apply to all types of content submitted to any of our services.<br/>
				<br/>All of our policies are carefully considered and developed with the help of smaller, closed communities before they are posted publicly to ensure that they work well in our communities. This is always an ongoing process, and these policies will change over time to reflect the experiences we gain throughout this work. We are always trying to strike the perfect balance between keeping everyone safe and giving everyone a voice.
				<br/><br/>You can find a full list of our Community Guidelines here:</p><br/><br/>

				<h2>Detecting Violations</h2>
				<p class="description">While we are currently a small group of people and our communities can easily be managed by human moderators, we also want to plan to implement solutions that scale well when our communities start growing rapidly. As such, we plan to employ machine learning algorithms to sift through the content that is being posted and bring content that may be harmful to our attention.
				<br/><br/>While our automated systems currently don't prevent content from being posted, they may do so in the future and report any attempts to post such content to us.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="category">
				<h2>Flagging Content</h2>
				<p class="description">We are committed to monitoring our communities and remove harmful content as much as is possible without the help of our users, but some harmful content may still slip through the cracks. If you find content that you think violates our community guidelines, please flag the post to alert our moderators to the issue. Please keep in mind that flagging content incorrectly may lead to moderation actions against your account as well.
				<br/><br/>Some content may be flagged by our automated systems.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="category">
				<h2>Enforcing our Policies</h2>
				<p class="description">At the moment, all moderation action is taken after a human moderator has reviewed a report. We take the safety of our communities very seriously. We generally adhere to a three-strikes system. Keep in mind that we may skip directly to harsher punishments if the severity of the infraction warrants doing so.
				<br/><br/>While we trust our moderators to be fair when assessing content and reports, you will be given a chance to discuss any moderation actions taken against you with our moderators. However, if we find you are trying to skirt the rules we put in place or get away using technicalities, we may escalate moderation actions further. In all cases, the spirit of the rules is paramount and our moderators reserve the right to hand out punishments if they feel your content is harmful even if the rules don't explicitly cover your case.</p>
				
				<ul class="bullets">
					<li><b>First Offence:</b> You will receive a written warning, and your account will be suspended for one day. In the message we send you, it will clearly be stated that this is your first strike.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Second Offence:</b> You will receive a written warning clearly stating this is your second strike, and your account will be suspended for one month.</li><br/>
					<li><b>Third Offence:</b> You will receive a written warning clearly stating this is your third and final strike, and your account (and any accounts we believe may also be under your control) will be permanently disabled.</li><br/>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Strikes on your account will be stored as remarks on your account permanently, but will generally expire after 6 months.</p>

			<section class="category">
				<h2>Legal Hold</h2>
				<p class="description">We may in the event of a serious offence that violates the law, suspend an account for the reason of "Legal Hold". A legal hold is a process that an organization uses to preserve all forms of potentially relevant information in the event of a legal matter.
				<br/><br/>This is done to ensure that we do not alter any information about the account during any legal investigation.</p>
