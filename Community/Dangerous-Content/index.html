# Harmful or Dangerous Content Policy
We don't allow any content that encourages dangerous or illegal activities that may risk serious physical harm or even death. If you happen to find any content that violates this policy, please immediately report it to us.

**Don't post content anywhere on our website(s) or social communities if any of the content you want to post fits any of the descriptions below:**

- **Instructions on how to kill/harm:** We don't allow any content that teaches people how to perform activities meant to kill or harm others. For example, giving instructions to build a bomb meant to injure or kill others.

- **Dangerous Challenges:** We don't allow the sharing of challenges that pose an imminent risk of physical injury.

- **Hard drug use or creation:** We don't support or condone of any content that depicts abuse of or giving instructions on how to create hard drugs such as cocaine or opioids. Hard drugs are defined as drugs that can (mostly) lead to physical addiction.

If you want to report and demonstrate security issues relating to Kat Digital. Please report them **in private** to our Security group on the developer forum: <a href="https://dev.kat.gg/g/Security" class="external">https://dev.kat.gg/g/Security</a>. We do not accept public posted reports as this could cause a lot more damage.

- **Promoting dangerous remedies or cures:** We do not support content which claims that harmful substances or treatments can have health benefits, especially with the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

Although this is **not** a complete list, please keep in mind what you're posting. If you're not sure that your content falls under this category, simply don't post it.

## Violations of this Policy
If your content violates this policy, we’ll remove the content and send you a message to let you know. If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you’ll get a warning with no penalty to your account. If it’s not, we’ll issue a strike against your account.
