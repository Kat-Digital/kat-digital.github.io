- Attacks a person's ethnicity or nationality
- Attacks a person based on their sexual orientation or identity
- Attacks a person based on their physical traits
- Attacks a person based on their skill level
- Uses false information to make a person question their abilities
- Attacks a person based on their status as a survivor of sexual assault, domestic abuse, child abuse, etc.
- Revealing someone’s private information, such as their home address, email addresses, sign-in credentials, phone numbers, passport number, or bank account information. 
This does not include public information such as a business address or phone number.
- Content featuring non-consensual sex acts, unwanted sexualization or anything that graphically sexualizes or degrades an individual.
- Content that displays or shows how to distribute non-consensual sexual imagery. 

If another user threatens you and you feel unsafe, please report this directly to your local law enforcement agency and our moderators.

Keep in mind, this is not a full list. If you are not sure whether or not your content violates this policy, simply do not post it.
